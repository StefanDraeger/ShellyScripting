# Shelly Scripting
Shelly Scripts are small programs that run directly on your Shelly device and allow you to customize its behaviour. For example, you can record sensor data, trigger certain actions based on conditions or integrate Shelly devices into more complex smart home systems.

The special thing about Shelly Scripts is that they are executed locally on the device. This means: no dependency on cloud services and no delays caused by external networks. You have full control and can design your automations according to your needs.

Shelly Script Language uses Espruino, a lightweight JavaScript environment that is ideal for embedded systems. Compared to previous versions, Espruino offers more compatibility with the JavaScript standard, providing a more familiar programming experience.
